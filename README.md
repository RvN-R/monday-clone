# monday-clone

## I built this project to practice my skills in React and learn how to incorporate Express to build a backend.

### To Run the App

- Open a new terminal and run - _cd monday-clone_
- Now in the correct directory you need to start up the backend, to do this run the following in a new terminal - _npm run start:backend_
- Now with the backend running you need to start up the fronten, to do this run the following in a new terminal - _npm run start:frontend_
- React should open a new tab in your browser and _localhost:3000_ should appear with the site.
